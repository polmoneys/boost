### TLDR

Attempt #5872046752 at extensible React TS components. [Demo](https://polmoneys.github.io/boost/)  

### Getting started

Add a folder under **packages** and configure both **vite.config.ts** and **package.json**, check other packages for reference. 

```bash

   # install any dependencies this package needs
   yarn install 
   
   # build
   yarn build

```

To use it on **demo** you must add it to **package.json** dependencies and import it on **App.tsx**.


### Troubleshooting

In workspace root folder:

```bash

   yarn install 

```

### Tooling

Yarn workspaces template for React TS library & app powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
